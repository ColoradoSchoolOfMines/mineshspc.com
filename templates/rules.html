      <h2>Teams</h2>
      <p>
        Teams must have a minimum of two students and a maximum of four students.
        <b>Teams must have a faculty sponsor.</b> If your school does not have a faculty sponsor,
        please reach out to us and we can make arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams can be made up of students from different schools as long as all students
	and faculty sponsors agree, provided one team cannot be made from the same school.
      </p>
      <h2>Internet Access & Code Generation</h2>
      <p>
        This competition is <b>open-internet</b> for in-person and remote participants. You may use
        the internet for looking up language documentation or researching algorithms. You may
        <b>not</b> use interactive online services such as chat rooms or forums to communicate with
        anyone during the competition. You may <b>not</b> communicate with anyone outside of your team.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problems are written specifically for the competition, so looking up the problems will
        not be useful. Additionally, the teams that do the best in the competition generally do not
        use the internet extensively during the competition because they already are familiar with
        their language's standard library and know a variety of algorithms that may be used to solve
        the problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Any third party code generation is not allowed.</b>
        Any team that uses code generation AI will be immediately disqualified and their school
        will be ineligible from participating in HSPC in future years. All solutions will
        be reviewed for AI use. We reserve the right to ask teams to explain the solution
        in detail to judges and revoke credit for solutions if the judges feel the team
        does not provide an adequate explanation.
      </p>
      <h2 id="bringing-own-tech">Bringing Your Own Technology</h2>
      <p>
        In-person teams will be <b>provided a single computer</b> for the competition. Teams may not
        use more than one Mines-provided computer. Teams <b>are allowed to bring and use additional
          computers</b> if they wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the computer provided is often an effective strategy as it allows team members to
        collaborate on solutions rather than having to work on their own.
      </p>
      <h2>Virtual Competitors</h2>
      <p>
        Colorado School of Mines has an institution Zoom license. Before the competition, registered
        teams will be sent a link to a Zoom conference specifically for the high school programming
        competition. For optimal security, the CS@Mines Zoom hosts will strictly control entrance to
        the Zoom platform, chatting, and screen-sharing.
      </p>
      <h2>Prizes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prize for each person in the first place team</li>
        <li>Prize for each person in the second place team</li>
        <li>Prize for each person in the third place team</li>
        <li>Certificate of completion for everyone</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rules and prizes are subject to change.</p>
