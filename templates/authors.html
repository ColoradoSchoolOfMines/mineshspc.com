      <h2>Writing Exciting Problems</h2>
      <p>
        The CS@Mines High School Programming Competition is a competition
        for high school students to write programs that solve problems.
        We model our programming competition off well-known college-level
        competitions such as the
        <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM ICPC</a>, but bring an
        inviting set of problems to the table suitable for high school
        students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mines students are encouraged join our problem writing process.
        In the past, we have had many authors from ACM, DECtech, and the
        CS@Mines department, as well as help from alumni. All of our
        problems are reviewed by CS@Mines professors.
      </p>
      <p>
        See the sections below to get involved!
        <b>Problems are due December 31st, 2022.</b>
      </p>
      <h2>The Problem Process</h2>
      <p>
        An outline of the problem process can be seen below. Once you
        join our GitHub organization, a full contribution guide is available.
        The bulk of the problem-making processes lies in making a well-defined
        problem and writing a solution and test cases for it.
      </p>

        Anyone can write and review problems! In the past, we have typically
        always needed extra reviewers. Along with writing your own problem, you
        can help us by writing solutions to other problems to ensure the best quality problems.
      </p>
      <h2>Get In Touch</h2>
      <p>
        We use <a href="https://github.com/ColoradoSchoolOfMines">GitHub</a> to store and collaborate on all of the
        problem code for HSPC. Due to the nature of the competition, this repository is private.
