        <h1>Engage in Exciting Problems</h1>
        <p>
          The CS@Mines High School Programming Competition is a competition
          for high school students to write programs that solve problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          We model our programming competition off well-known college-level
          competitions such as <a href="https://icpc.global">ICPC</a>, but bring an
          inviting set of problems to the table suitable for high school
          students. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2023 competition will include <strong>four</strong> available tracks in the 
          form of both <strong>in-person and virtual</strong> competitions, which compete at 
          the same day and time. Both competitions are offered in two levels of difficulty: 
          <strong>Beginner</strong>, for  students with basic computing experience and 
          <strong>advanced</strong>, for students with significant computing experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Registration is now open and closes March 2023.

      <h2>Where can I find practice problems?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The best way to practice is by solving the problems from previous
        competitions. You can find the problems from past competitions here:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://mines21.kattis.com/problems">2021</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://mines20.kattis.com/problems">2020</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://mines19.kattis.com/problems">2019</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://mines18.kattis.com/problems">2018</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://open.kattis.com" target="_blank">Open Kattis Archive</a>
        has archived problems from many historical programming competitions
        as well. Start with the easy problems first!
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the Kattis system to run the competition, so the
        problems will be given in a similar input/output format.

      <h1>Prizes</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Prize for each person in the first place team</li>
        <li>Prize for each person in the second place team</li>
        <li>Certificate of completion for everyone!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Virtual Competitors</h2>
      <p>
        Colorado School of Mines has an institution Zoom license. Before the
        competition, registered teams will be sent a link to the high school
        programming competition. For optimal security, the CS@Mines Zoom
        hosts will strictly control entrance to the Zoom platform, chatting,
        and screen-sharing.
