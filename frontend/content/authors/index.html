        <h2>Write Exciting Problems</h2>
        <p>
          The CS@Mines High School Programming Competition is a competition
          for high school students to write programs that solve problems.
          We model our programming competition off well-known college-level
          competitions such as the
          <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM ICPC</a>, but bring an
          inviting set of problems to the table suitable for high school
          students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mines students are encouraged join our problem writing process.
          In the past, we have had many authors from ACM, DECtech, and the 
          CS@Mines department, as well as help from alumni. All of our
          problems are reviewed by CS@Mines professors.
        </p>

          See the sections below to get involved!
          <b>Problems are due December 31st, 2022.</b>

        <h2>The Problem Process</h2>
        <p>
          An outline of the problem process can be seen below. Once you
          join our GitHub organization, a full contribution guide is available.

          Anyone can write and review problems! In the past, we have typically
          always needed extra reviewers. Along with writing your own problem, you
          can help us by writing solutions to other problems to ensure the best quality problems.
        </p>
