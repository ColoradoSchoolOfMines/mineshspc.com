      <h2>Where can I find practice problems?</h2>
      <p>
        The best way to practice is by solving the problems from previous
        competitions. You can find the problems from past competitions here:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://mines22advanced.kattis.com/problems">2022 Advanced</a> and
          <a href="https://mines22beginner.kattis.com/problems">2022 Beginner</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://mines21.kattis.com/problems">2021</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://mines20.kattis.com/problems">2020</a></li>

        <li><a href="https://mines18.kattis.com/problems">2018</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://open.kattis.com" target="_blank">Open Kattis Archive</a>
        has archived problems from many historical programming competitions
        as well. Start with the easy problems first!
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use Kattis to run the competition, so all the problems will be given in a similar
        input/output format.
      </p>
      <h2>How many people can be on my team?</h2>
      <p>
        We recommend a team size of three, but will allow teams of two or
        four. Teams of more than four students are not allowed, nor is it
        allowed to compete individually.
      </p>
      <h2>What languages can we use?</h2>
      <p>
        You can use C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, or Ruby.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend that everyone on your team know at least one of these languages in common. We
        additionally recommend that teams practice submitting solutions on Kattis because the
        input/output is done in a very specific manner that students may not be familiar with.
      </p>
      <h2>What editors do the competition computers have?</h2>
      <p>
        The competition computers run Linux (<a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>'s latest distribution) and have the following programs installed:

      </p>
      <h2>How long is the competition?</h2>
      <p>
        The Kattis competition will be open for 4 hours, from <b>10:00 AM until 2:00 PM Mountain Time</b>.
        There are opening and closing ceremonies lasting an hour at the start and end of the
        competition, respectively.
      </p>
      <h2>Can I bring my own laptop or tablet?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. However, we find that using less computers benefits team problem solving ability as
        there is more opportunity for collaboration.
