      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

          <h1>Engage in Exciting Problems</h1>
          <p>
            The CS@Mines High School Programming Competition is a competition
            for high school students to write programs that solve problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            We model our programming competition off well-known college-level
            competitions such as the
            <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM ICPC</a>, but bring an
            inviting set of problems to the table suitable for high school
            students.
          </p>
          <h2>How many people can be on my team?</h2>
          <p>
            We recommend a team size of three, but will allow teams of two or
            four. Teams of more than four students are not allowed, nor is it
            allowed to compete individually.
          </p>
          <h2>What languages can we use?</h2>
          <p>
            You can use C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, or Ruby. We recommend
            that everyone on your team know at least one of these languages in
            common.
          </p>
          <!--
          <p>
          We will provide a variety of text editors and compilers on the
          competition PCs for each of the languages listed above. If you need a
          specific software, please email your request to David Florness
          (davidflorness@mines.edu).
          </p>
          -->
          <h2>Where can I find practice problems?</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The best way to practice is by solving the problems from previous
            competitions. You can find the problems from past competitions here:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://mines21.kattis.com/problems">2021</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://mines20.kattis.com/problems">2020</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://mines19.kattis.com/problems">2019</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://mines18.kattis.com/problems">2018</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The
            <a href="https://open.kattis.com" target="_blank"
              >Open Kattis Archive</a
            >
            has archived problems from many historical programming competitions
            as well. Start with the easy problems first!
          </p>
          <p>
            We will use the Kattis system to run the competition, so the
            problems will be given in a similar input/output format.
          </p>
          <h2>Virtual Competitors</h2>
          <p>
            Colorado School of Mines has an institution Zoom license. Before the
            competition, registered teams will be sent a link to the high school
            programming competition. For optimal security, the CS@Mines Zoom
            hosts will strictly control entrance to the Zoom platform, chatting,
            and screen-sharing.

          <h1>Plans for 2022:</h1>
          <p>
            There will be FOUR tracks in the competition this year, all of which
            will compete the same day/time. Two tracks will be on Mines campus
            and two tracks will be virtual. One track will be for students with
            significant prior computing experience and one track will be for
            students with basic prior computing experience. Registration is now
            open and will close March 17th, 2022.
