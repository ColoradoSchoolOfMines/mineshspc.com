          <h2>Registration Information</h2>
          <p>
            The CS@Mines High School Programming Competition will be [TBA]. 
          </p>
          <p>
            There will be TWO tracks in the competition this year (beginner and advanced), both of which can be done either virtually or in person. (All members of a given team must be fully in person OR fully on Zoom). 
          </p>
          <p>
            The beginner competition assumes knowledge of foundational programming concepts, which we consider to be expressions, conditionals, loops, and lists, as well as nested loops and lists. Some problems may be easily solved with knowledge of more advanced CS concepts, but all can be solved with just foundational concepts. The following are sample problems that represent the typical difficulty of problems in the beginner competition:
            <br><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/quadrant">https://open.kattis.com/problems/quadrant</a>
            <br><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/tornbygge">https://open.kattis.com/problems/tornbygge</a>
            <br><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/secretmessage">https://open.kattis.com/problems/secretmessage</a>
        </p>
        <p>            
            The advanced competition assumes knowledge of more advanced CS concepts, including data structures like maps, sets, and trees. Some problems require knowledge of algorithms such as BFS, or advanced data structures such as priority queues. Some simpler problems will also be included to balance the difficulty of the competition. The following are sample problems that represent the typical difficulty of problems in the advanced competition:
            <br><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/grandpabernie">https://open.kattis.com/problems/grandpabernie</a>
            <br><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/ladice">https://open.kattis.com/problems/ladice</a>

        </p>
        <p>            
            This form must be completed by a sponsoring teacher of a team registering to participate. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Teachers: 
            <ol>
                <li>Please organize students into teams so those with "more experience" (or "less experience") are in the same team.</li>
                <li>Please sign up your student team to the appropriate competition (i.e., don't put a team with advanced skills into the beginner competition)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>If students have participated in the Mines HSPC previously (and have not graduated yet), we recommend the advanced competition!</i></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Please complete this form for <strong>EACH team</strong> you are registering and specify the team's preference for in person or virtual</li>
                <li>Please provide student's school email address, if possible. If sharing the student’s school email address is a problem, please create a “1-time” email address for each student that they can use for the competition (e.g., mailinator).</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p> 
            If more teams register than space exists for the in person competition, then only two teams from a given school will be allowed to attend in person (other teams can participate over Zoom, if desired). 
            We will circle back with teachers if they can only send two teams to the in person competition (i.e., teachers will inform us with which teams will attend in person). 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Deadline to register is [TBA]. If you need more time to register, please email Christine Liebe at <a href="mailto:cliebe@mines.edu">cliebe@mines.edu</a>. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            If health conditions allow, an optional campus tour of Mines will be available from 3-4pm (for those interested).  
        </p>
        <p> 
            A practice competition will be available from Monday (April 4) - Friday (April 8), for those teachers/students interested in preparing for the competition on Saturday April 9. Details on this practice competition will be sent to teachers that register team(s). 
        </p>
        <p> 
            If your team membership changes after you have completed this form, please email Christine Liebe at <a href="mailto:cliebe@mines.edu">cliebe@mines.edu</a>. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            <b>NOTE: Participating students must be 13 years of age (or older) AND must have parental consent AND must be in high school.</b>
