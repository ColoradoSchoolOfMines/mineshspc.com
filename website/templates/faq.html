      <h2>How should I prepare for the competition?</h2>
      <p>
        The best way to practice is by solving the problems from previous
        competitions. You can find this all on our <a href="https://mineshspc.com/archive">archive page</a>.

        We will use Kattis to run the competition, so all the problems will be given in a similar
        input/output format to those seen in the <a href="https://open.kattis.com" target="_blank">Open Kattis Archive</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>How many people can be on my team?</h2>
      <p>
        Teams must have a minimum of two students and a maximum of four students.
      </p>
      <h2>How many teams can we have?</h2>
      <p>
        We allow for two teams per school to attend our in-person competition
        (we may allow more based on registration time and available space).

        Any number of teams can join in the virtual open division.
      </p>
      <h2>What languages can we use?</h2>
      <p>
        You can use C++, Python, Java or JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend that everyone on your team know at least one of these languages in common. We
        additionally recommend that teams practice submitting solutions on Kattis because the
        input/output is done in a very specific manner that students may not be familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ensure that your team knows how to take in Kattis input <b>before the competition day</b>;
        see the <a href="https://open.kattis.com/help">Kattis input tutorial</a> for more details.
        We will also send out a link to a practice competition to practice submitting code.
      </p>
      <h2>What editors do the competition computers have?</h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Editors: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>,

      <h2 id="division">What divison should I register my team in?</h2>
      <p>
        The beginner competition includes foundational programming concepts such as: arithmetic, expressions, conditionals, loops, lists, and nested loops and lists.
        View <a href="https://mines23beginner.kattis.com/contests/mines23beginner/problems">last year's beginner problems</a> for a good idea of the difficulty of the beginner problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advanced competition includes advanced programming concepts such as: data structures (maps, sets), algorithms (BFS/DFS/sorting),
        and advanced data structures (stacks, queues, trees). A few simpler problems are also included.

      </p>
      <h2>How long is the competition?</h2>
      <p>
        The actual competition will be open for 4 hours, from <b>10:00 AM until 2:00 PM Mountain Time</b>.
        There are opening and closing ceremonies lasting an hour at the start and end of the competition.
      </p>
      <h2>Can I bring my own device?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. However, we find that using less computers benefits team problem solving ability as
        there is more opportunity for collaboration.

        See the <a href="/rules/#bringing-own-tech">rules</a> for details.
