      <h2>How many people can be on my team?</h2>
      <p>
        We recommend a team size of three, but will allow teams of two or
        four. Teams of more than four students are not allowed, nor is it
        allowed to compete individually.
      </p>
      <h2>What languages can we use?</h2>
      <p>
        You can use C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, or Ruby. We recommend
        that everyone on your team know at least one of these languages in
        common.
      </p>
      <h2>What editors do the competition PCs have?</h2>
      <p>
        The competition PCs run on Linux (Distribution: <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> latest) and have <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>,
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/">Eclipse</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>How long is the actual competition?</h2>
      <p>
        Kattis will be open for 4 hours, from 10:00am-2:00pm Mountain Time. 
        There are announcements for an hour at the start and end of the competition.
      </p>
      <h2>Can I bring my own laptop or tablet?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes! As per the rules, teams are only allowed to use <strong>one</strong>
        competition PC. We find that this benefits team problem solving ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, participants are welcome to bring their own laptops and tablets
        if they wish. There are no software requirements for laptops or tablets,
        only that you can sign into Kattis to submit problems.
      </p>
      <h2>Where can I find practice problems?</h2>
      <p>
        The best way to practice is by solving the problems from previous
        competitions. You can find the problems from past competitions here:

        has archived problems from many historical programming competitions
        as well. Start with the easy problems first!
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the Kattis system to run the competition, so the
        problems will be given in a similar input/output format.
